<h1 id="gov-uk-design-system-prototypes">GOV.UK design system prototypes</h1>

<p>These prototypes explore options for publishing design resources on GOV.UK. <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_design_prototypes">The source code is available on GitHub</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="alpha"><a href="/service-toolkit">Alpha</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Update link from service toolkit</li>
<li>Update aliases</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-round-6"><a href="https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-6.cloudapps.digital/design-patterns/patterns/">Research round 6</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Remove “Status” labels and introduced “Experimental” </li>
<li>Change to Gov.uk Design</li>
<li>Move search bar to main header</li>
<li>Add a visual browse (tiles) to the home page for “Popular resources”</li>
<li>Change current structure to  Visual styles | Components | Pages | Patterns

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> Allow us to use this library for all Design related content, not just web / CSS.</li>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> Users, although confident with Styles and Components didn&rsquo;t know what to expect within User Tasks or Services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Change name to “Design System”</li>
<li>Add Design Principles</li>
<li>Merge “User tasks” and “Services” content</li>
<li>Brought back themes within sections (switchable) and added the ability to order themes manually

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Reckon:</span> Although initially this didn&rsquo;t test well I reckon this was around the groupings themselves and the order they appearred in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changed search bar background colour to blue

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> Not break existing design signifiers on gov.uk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added Breadcrumbs component in new format

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> Understand the process of pattern submission</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-round-5"><a href="https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-5.cloudapps.digital/service-toolkit">Research round 5</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Moved to horizontal navigation for main sections

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> Users in previous rounds seemed overwhelmed by the amount of content in the left hand navigation and some found the interaction confusing. Horizontal nav also will be more future proof as the amount of patterns increase.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Removed tabs and added discussion back in at the bottom

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> There wasn&rsquo;t a great deal of interaction with the tabs in research and the current <code>code</code> examples will be inline with the examples. There may be a need to incorproate a separate code view again when integrated with Gov.uk Frontend</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Re-classified many components as User Tasks

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Reckon:</span> Components should on the most part be generic - “Form date group” is a component, “Enter a date” is a user task using the form date group component.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added separate “Pattern status” page</li>
<li>Changed <code>h2</code> font size</li>
<li>Re-classified many components with more appropriate status</li>
<li>Created two variants for the &lsquo;Autocomplete&rsquo; alpha pattern to test with –
<a href="/design-patterns/patterns/components/autocomplete/">&#39;Slim&rsquo;</a> and 
<a href="/design-patterns/patterns/components/autocomplete/expanded.html">&#39;Expanded&rsquo;</a>.
Only the slim version shows up in navigation and search.
</li></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-round-4">Research round 4</h2>

<h3 id="version-2"><a href="https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-4-v2.cloudapps.digital/service-toolkit">Version 2</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>changed the labels of 2 of the levels in the nav (pages to page templates, tasks to user tasks), to make them clearer

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> Users largely understood the concept of “Styles” and “Components” but “Pages”, “Tasks” and “Services” needed more explanation. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>updated the &#39;contribute&rsquo; page based on the work we&rsquo;ve been doing on our contribution model</li>
<li>list all patterns by section on a new browse page, to allow users to understand the structure of the thing</li>
<li>added status tabs to the browse page, with descriptions of each status</li>
<li>list all patterns by section on the browse page to allow users to understand the structure of the thing

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Reckon:</span> This will help orientate users on their first visit as well as support different user types (non design / development practitioner’s)<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="version-1"><a href="https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-4-v1.cloudapps.digital/service-toolkit">Version 1</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Added working <a href="/docs/search.html">search functionality</a>

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> Many users in the previous round of research interacted with the search input or suggested search would be their preference.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Updated the styling of the navigation so users have a better understanding of hierarchy

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> In research many users were unaware that the sections were expandable. Some users were unaware that there were multiple sections and not just one list.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changed styling of status tag

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> In research some users confused the pattern status with the status of the “Design Patterns” prototype as a whole.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-round-3"><a href="https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-3.cloudapps.digital/v9/govuk_service_toolkit/">Research round 3</a></h2>

<p>In this version we:</p>

<ul>
<li>refactored the code so we can generate pages and navigation using YAML frontmatter</li>
<li>added lots of missing patterns from the master list</li>
<li>added aliases for patterns

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> Users have expressed that the search should be intelligent enough to recognise alternative names for patterns as well as related concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added a prioritised backlog page</li>
<li>added a departmental patterns page

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> test the concept of departmental patterns and talk about contribution models.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added an patterns statistics page

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Reckon:</span> By making a statistics page it gives context to the Design Patterns project, adds visibility outside of GDS, gives an overview of all of the patterns in the library.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>removed the anchored heading icon 

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> it confused one user and is less relevant for multi-page docs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added the ability to style left nav items according to pattern status</li>
<li>Embedded the Hackpads in the pattern pages

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> Users have continually voiced that “It&rsquo;s better to have everything in one place”. Despite some reservations around using the hackpad embed code it feels useful and will expose conversation, history and research of a pattern.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added &#39;Guide&rsquo;, &#39;Code&rsquo; and &#39;Discussion&rsquo; tabs to the top of each pattern

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Reckon:</span> That there are different users and different use cases for guidance, code and discussion. Presenting them all on one page might be confusing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added pattern status to items in navigation

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> In research some users mentioned navigating to “Backlog” patterns all the time was frustrating. This will help reveal the status of the pattern before any user interaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added more placeholder content for backlog patterns</li>
<li>updated typography to use “elements” sizing / spacing</li>
<li>added a &#39;theme&rsquo; meta-data item and group patterns in each nav section by theme

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Reckon:</span> As the components section increases in size it becomes hard to navigate. User&rsquo;s are more likely to be looking for related components at the same time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added GOV.UK Frontend documentation</li>
<li>added &ldquo;last edited date&rdquo;

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> In research many of the users mentioned looking for a “single source of truth” - a last edited date would help them justify a decision to prioritse one pattern over another. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>added link to community page from status tag

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> In research many of the users were observed clicking the status tag to find out what it meant</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="research-round-2"><a href="https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-2.cloudapps.digital/v8/govuk_service_toolkit/">Research round 2</a></h2>

<p>In this version we:</p>

<ul>
<li>redesigned the Design Patterns landing page to make it consistent with other GDS product pages

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> make experience consistant when browsing from the Service Toolkit page.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added primary nav to the Design Patterns header to make it more consistent with other GDS product pages</li>
<li>moved the search from the Design Patterns header into the left nav of the Patterns section

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> make it clearer that the search input was related to the content within the navigation<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>made it so users now jump straight into the first pattern

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Reckon:</span> By starting with the first section open we hope to give the users a hint about how the navigation works and how patterns are presented.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>tweaked the colour pattern, as it&rsquo;s now the first one users see</li>
<li>removed previous and next links from pattern pages

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">Findings:</span> In research these were seen as unessasasry and there was confusion about what &ldquo;next&rdquo; would mean in this context.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>updated Service Toolkit and Design Patterns landing page copy to use more keywords</li>
<li>reorganised the Service Toolkit page around activities</li>
<li>added a &#39;contact the team&rsquo; call to action</li>
<li>made patterns order alphabetically within each category</li>
<li>changed the way nav works so we can add meta data (like status) against each pattern</li>
<li>updated the GOV.UK Frontend product page to make it consistent with other product pages

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> avoid breaking user journey in prototype – When testing patterns with FE Developers we don&rsquo;t want to break their journey if they click this link from the toolkit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added a product page for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> avoid breaking user journey in prototype.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>removed seperate departmental libraries for now</li>
<li>added links back to the Service Toolkit from each product page

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> avoid breaking user journey in prototype.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>added status and meta data

<ul>
<li><span class="reason-for-change">To:</span> allow us to filter and sort by pattern status – It is assumed that there is a benefit to see patterns of all statuses and only individually.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-round-1"><a href="https://govuk-design-system-prototypes-round-1.cloudapps.digital/">Research round 1</a></h2>

<p>In this version we:</p>

<ul>
<li>explored different ways of organising departmental patterns in relation to &#39;global&rsquo; patterns</li>
<li>explored the idea of a single &#39;design system&rsquo; product</li>
<li>explored a single-page version of the patterns in the Service Manual that used the tech doc format</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="research-round-0">Research round 0</h2>

<p>Before making a prototype we:</p>

<ul>
<li>researched existing pattern libraries and style guides <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11hp4fIAqAmonc4ATW7mJA7cdkN5soqRpU4AROBUGvBQ/edit?ts=58db7b35#gid=0">Audit spreadsheet</a> | <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/presentation/d/1i5IfJWq5jEv2VcZp6ra50AnGJXZBJJmz8d3ts0KnhSk/edit?usp=sharing">Visual audit</a></li>
<li>looked at some “Off the shelf” solutions</li>
<li>looked at how this could re-use some of the concepts and styling of the “Tech docs format”</li>
</ul>
