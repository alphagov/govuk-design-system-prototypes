# Archived prototypes

## [Version 4](/v4/service-toolkit)
* GOV.UK Design Patterns
* Departmental patterns are seperate but part of same site

## [Version 3](/v3/service-toolkit)
* GOV.UK Design Patterns
* Departmental patterns are seperate departmental sites

## [Version 2](/v2/service-toolkit)

In this version, design patterns are kept seperate from the other design resources.

Departmental pattern libraries are listed in the left navigation, but the departmental patterns themselves are linked to from an index page. 

Departmental patterns are not restricted to the same categories as the global patterns.


## [Version 1](/v1/service-toolkit)

In this version, design principles, patterns and tools are all wrapped up into a single 'design system' product.

## Research questions

* should navigation groups have index pages?
* if so, do people notice them?
* does the toolkit CONTAIN content, or is it just an index page?
