Avoid unnecessary decoration - only use icons if there’s a real user need.

## Icons

* if icons are needed ensure they are clear, simple and accompanied by relevant text
* don’t hide functionality under icons

GOV.UK standard icons are provided, as well as organisation crests and media player icons – find these in the GOV.UK frontend toolkit images folder.

### Legal text

Use bold text with an exclamation icon if there are legal consequences - for example, a fine or prison sentence.

<% partial "/layouts/example" do %>
<div class="text">
	<div class="notice">
		<i class="icon icon-important">
			<span class="visually-hidden">Warning</span>
		</i>
		<strong class="bold-small">
			You can be fined up to £5,000 if you don’t register.
		</strong>
	</div>
</div>
<% end %>
