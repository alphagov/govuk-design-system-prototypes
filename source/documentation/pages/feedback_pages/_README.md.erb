If you’re building a digital service, you’ll need to provide a way for users to give you feedback on their experience of using it.


### Example

### Why your service must have a feedback page

All public beta or live services must have a feedback page so you can collect comments and [measure user satisfaction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction).

The page must be hosted on GOV.UK so satisfaction scores can be compared across services on the [performance platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance).


### Get a feedback page

Contact your organisation’s content team to get a feedback page on GOV.UK for your public beta or live service. They’ll need to [make a content request](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_change_request/new).

If your service is in alpha or private beta, you can create your own feedback page.


### When to make your request

You should contact your organisation’s content team to discuss your feedback page and [start page](#start-pages) at least 1 month before your beta assessment.

GOV.UK will only publish your feedback page when your service:

- passes its beta assessment or self-certification
- goes into public beta
