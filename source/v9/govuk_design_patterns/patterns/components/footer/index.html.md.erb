All services should use the following footer as a minimum:

![Image of footer](footer.png)

Appropriate service-specific links can be added to the footer. For example:

- terms and conditions
- privacy policy
- data protection notice
- cookie notice
- links to APIs and data feeds
- link to the responsible department (not to a commercial supplier)
- language options

Make sure that you don't encourage users to leave transactions part-way through in a way that means they can't recover.
