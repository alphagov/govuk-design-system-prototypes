This guide explains how to tell users they’ve completed a transaction.


### Example of a confirmation page

![Example of a confirmation page](/documentation/pages/confirmation_pages/Confirmation_Pages_1.png)

There’s an [example of this confirmation page](http://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/examples/confirmation-page) in the [GOV.UK prototyping kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).


### Information you need to include

Your confirmation page should include:

- a reference number (if there is one)
- details of what happens next and when
- contact details for the service
- links to information or services that users are likely to need next
- a link to your feedback page, where users can tell you what they think of the service
- a way for users to save a record of the transaction (for example, as a PDF)


### Helping users who bookmark the page

Some users will bookmark the confirmation page as a form of receipt. If you can, you should allow them to return to the page.

If you can’t, make sure your service responds in a helpful way when users return using a bookmarked link. For example, if people use your service to make an application you could provide links to information on:

- tracking an application
- starting a new application
- what to do (or who to contact) if you have a problem with your application
