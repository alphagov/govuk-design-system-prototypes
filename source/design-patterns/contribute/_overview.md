# Contribution guidelines

This collection of patterns has been developed by the government design community.

There are lots of ways that you can get involved.


## How to suggest improvements to patterns

All design patterns have a discussion space, where you can share examples and ask questions.

If you'd like to go further and suggest actual improvements to the guidance you can do this by raising a pull request on Github.


## How to develop a new pattern

We use Github to manage the development of all our design patterns. 
Here's a step by step guide for developing a new pattern.


### 1. Submit your idea for a pattern

All ideas for patterns should be submitted to our backlog first. 

A pattern will be accepted if it is:

**Useful:** thereâ€™s a clear user need for this pattern across multiple services.

**Unique:** the pattern does not already exist in this collection or backlog.

[Submit a pattern idea to the backlog](#).


### 2. Develop a pattern on the backlog

You can start developing a pattern on the backlog if you have the resources to develop it at least as far as beta.

Submit a pull request on the backlog pattern, changing its status to 'In-progress'.

In the details of the pull request, briefly outline your plan for developing the pattern.

Before you start developing a pattern you should have:

- a designer and a researcher
- a developer if you're creating code
- at least 3 rounds of iteration planned

We recommend a 2 phased approach to developing design patterns:

#### Phase 1: Principles

In phase 1 the main activities are:

- collecting examples of the pattern from service teams in government
- talk to the teams about how well the pattern is performing in their service
- derive some high level principles for the pattern
- gather evidence to support those principles


#### Phase 2: Code

In phase 2 the main activities are:

- using the principles to develop prototypes of the pattern
- testing and iterating the prototypes
- developing a production version of the pattern
- testing and iterating the pattern in a live service

All patterns should follow our existing standards for design, code, content and accessibility.

Once your pattern is working well you can submit a pull request to change its status to beta.


### 3. Beta patterns

Beta patterns are ready to be used by the rest of the design community.

Be prepared to respond to suggestions and pull requests as teams try out your pattern in their prototypes and services.

If you're unable to support the pattern in beta that's fine - just change the owner back to GDS.


### 4. Approved patterns

Once the pattern is being used sucessfully in multiple live services and has become relatively stable it can be submitted for approval by the cross-governmentt patterns team.

Teams are assessed against their use of approved patterns in Service Assessments.
