# How to use these design patterns

How you should use these patterns depends on what status they have.


## Approved patterns

Approved patterns have been tested thoroughly and are working sucesfully in multiple services.

If your service is undergoing a live or beta assessment you will be expected to follow the guidance in these patterns.


## Beta patterns

Beta patterns have been researched and follow our design standards, but have not yet been tried in multiple services and are therefore likely to change.

We encourage you to try these patterns in your service and give feedback or suggest improvements to the owner.

You will not be assessed against your use of these patterns.


## In-progress patterns

These patterns are being actively developed by a team, but may not be complete or fully researched yet.

We encourage you to try these patterns in your service and give feedback or suggest improvements to the owner.

You will not be assessed against your use of these patterns.


## Backlog patterns

Backlog patterns are ones for which there's a broad user need but that no-one is actively working on yet.

We encourage you to discuss these patterns and, if you're able to, start developing them.
