This guide explains how to ask users for their email address.


### Example

When asking users for their email address, you should:

- make the field long enough
- make it clear why you’re asking
- help users to enter a valid email address

You may also need to check that users have access to the email account they give you.


### Make the field long enough

Make sure the field is long enough to accommodate at least 95% of your users’ email addresses.

You can analyse your user data to establish what this is. A good rule of thumb is 30 characters.


### Tell users why you want the email address

Make it clear what the email address will be used for so that:

- users feel confident that you’re not going to abuse it
- users with multiple email addresses can choose which one to give you
- Help users to enter a valid email address
- Help your users to enter a valid email address by:
	- checking that what they’ve entered is in the format of an email address
	- checking for common typos like ‘gnail’ instead of ‘gmail’
	- allowing users to paste the email address
	- using the type=“email” attribute so that devices display the correct keyboard
	- play their address back to them so they can check and change it

Some services ask users to repeat their email address. This adds work for the user and should not be implemented unless your research has shown it to be effective.


### Checking the user has access to their email account

You can use an [email confirmation loop](#email-confirmation-loops) to confirm that the user has access to the email address they gave you.

They can be a very disruptive user experience, so you should try not to use them.
