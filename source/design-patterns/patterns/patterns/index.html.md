title: Patterns
---

Here you will find best practice guidance and design solutions for specific user tasks and scenarios.

Some of the patterns in this section contain coded examples, others are written guidance. Patterns often use single or combinations of <a href="">components</a> and describe their use in context of their relationship to the user.

##Rules for services

If you are creating a service that will be hosted on a <strong>service.gov.uk</strong> domain you should use the appropriate <a href="#">patterns</a> and <a href="#">components</a>. It’s ok to adapt these patterns for specific use cases discovered through user research.


##Using GOV.UK patterns elsewhere

The code and guidance found in <a href="#">patterns</a> and <a href="#">components</a> should be considered best practice, with the appropriate adjustments made to fit with the needs of your users and style of your organisation.
