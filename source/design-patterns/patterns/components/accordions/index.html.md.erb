## Before you start

Decide if an accordion is the right component to use in your situation. Accodions are a way of grouping content so users can get a quick overview of what a section may contain when arriving at a page. Accordions are only nessasary if the amount of content on a page is causing user’s to feel frustrated or overwhelmed and if your content can be organised into meaningful groups, easily recognised by a title.

## Things to try first

Before using an accordion test your design with all of the content exposed first, it’s important not to hide content unless it is causing significant user frustration. You can also try changing the page level architecture of your design, perhaps breaking your groups into separate pages.

## Using accordions

If you have tested the alternatives and want to include accordions in your design they should:

- be primarily used for navigation
- have clear and meaningful titles
- have clear separators and large interaction areas
- be clickable or pressable from any point within the section
- be navigable with keyboard interactions
- be thouroughly tested with your user base


## When not to use accordions

Accordions should not be used to:

- intentionally hide content from users
- house content not available on a proceeding page
- group links together that have no relationship, for example “Other“
