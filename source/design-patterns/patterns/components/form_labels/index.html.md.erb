## Labels

- all form fields should be given labels
- donâ€™t hide labels, unless the surrounding context makes them unnecessary
- labels should be aligned above their fields
- label text should be short, direct and in sentence case
- avoid colons at the end of labels
- labels should be associated with form fields using the `for` attribute

<% partial "/layouts/example" do %>
<label class="form-label" for="full-name-f1">Full name</label>
<input class="form-control" id="full-name-f1" type="text">
<% end %>
