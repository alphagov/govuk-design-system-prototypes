description: An autocomplete component helps users find something in a known list of options
---

## Overview

An autocomplete component that:

- helps users find something in a known list of options
- helps you suggest results related to something a user has searched for
- is accessible to all users

Example:

You can try a [demo of the autocomplete component][demo] and [share your
feedback on Hackpad](#hackpad).

## When to use this pattern

Use this autocomplete component when:

- users need to pick from a known set of options (for example, medical
  conditions or days of the week)
- users are likely to recognise the right option when they see it
- users can know what answer they need to give without seeing the full list
  (e.g. what was the last country you visited?)
- the list of options is too long for a set of radio buttons or checkboxes
- there are multiple names or ways to describe something
- you want to let users use their own language and allow for spelling errors

## When not to use this pattern

You shouldn’t use autocomplete when:

- users won’t know the name of the option they need, or won’t be able to
  identify it
- users might not know the answer without seeing the full list (e.g. which
  countries have you visited? - they might know some, but may need the full list
  to prompt them) 
- users won’t know what to search for
- the results are too similar
- you can’t predict the majority of answers (in this case, it’s better to use a
  free text box)

## How it works

### Give clear options

You shouldn’t use autocompletes as a solution to poor content or service design.

If your options are confusingly named, avoid the temptation to use autocomplete
to provide long lists of alternative names. Instead, work with your team to make
the names clearer.

### Start with an empty text box to inform options

Autocomplete helps users choose from a given set of answers. If you don’t know
what options to provide, start with an empty box when your service is in beta to
see what sorts of things users answer with.

For instance, you could use autocomplete to collect data about common complaints
as part of a complaint form, but you may not initially know what options to fill
it with, or the language people use.

Start with an empty text box to find out what things people complain about and
how they describe them.

### Autocompletes are a form of progressive enhancement

Autocomplete requires JavaScript, so you must provide a non-JavaScript fallback
for users who don’t have it.

This might be a dropdown menu (when the user must pick an option from a list),
or an empty text box (when the user can type anything).

## Research on this pattern

This pattern has been tested as a country picker which helps users
to select a country.

Read a blog post about the [how the autocomplete component has been tested and iterated](https://docs.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/document/d/1OdLa3rioziYkB7f5QPFkRp-Fg2m-Vphq09BNeumq8Hc/edit?usp=sharing).

### Next steps

More research is needed to find out:

- how it works in scenarios other than picking a country
- what metadata is useful to show to users (for example, categorisation of
  things)
- how results should be ordered
- how comfortable users are with changing previous answers
- whether users are comfortable providing an answer that isn’t in the list
- whether it would be helpful to show the list when users first focus it
