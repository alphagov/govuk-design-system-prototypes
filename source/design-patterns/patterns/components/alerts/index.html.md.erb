###Prototype design

For research purposes the initial design style was taken directly from Bootstrap and contained four types of alert.

###Research round one

After testing with 5 users we found

- The error alert was considered to be the most useful
- Users liked the "Success" message but didn't think it needed to be the same style
- Couldn't think of an example of what "info" and "standard" alerts would be used for

###Action points for round two

- Design our own alerts in the Gov.uk style
- Consider accessibility - Positive / negative sentiment only expressed through colour
- Focus on error and success alerts
