**This is an HMRC pattern. You should only use this if the service you're
designing is an HMRC service, or has the same database requirements as HMRC.**

## Overview

<% partial "/layouts/example" do %>
<h1 class="heading-large">Find your address</h1>

<div class="form-group">
  <label class="form-label" for="postcode">Postcode</label>
  <input class="form-control form-control-1-3" type="text" name="postcode" value="">
</div>

<div class="form-group">
  <label class="form-label" for="house_number">House name or number (optional)</label>
  <input class="form-control" type="text" name="house_number" value=""><br><br>
</div>
<% end %>

## When to use this pattern

Use an address lookup when you’re asking users for a UK address.

## When not to use this pattern

Address lookups generally only work for UK addresses. If you’re collecting only
or mostly international addresses, you should use a manual option (either
[multiple fields](index.html#using-multiple-fields) or a [free text
box](index.html#using-a-free-text-box)) instead.

## How it works

An address lookup lets users specify a UK address by entering their postcode
(and optionally their street name or number) and selecting their address from a
list.

### When using an address lookup, you should:

- make it clear that it will only work for UK addresses
- provide a manual option for people with international addresses or addresses
  that are missing or not properly listed in the address lookup
- let people enter their postcodes in upper or lower case and with or without
  spaces

## Why this pattern is different from the GOV.UK pattern

This address lookup more closely matches the current back end database structure
that HMRC has. Since introducing this pattern, HMRC has been able to increase
the quality of addresses captured.
