**This is an HMRC pattern, you should only use this if the service you're designing is and HMRC service, or have the same database requirments as HMRC.**


## Using an address lookup

<% partial "/layouts/example" do %>
    <div class="form-group">
        <h1 class="heading-large">Find your address</h1>
        <label class="form-label" for="postcode">Postcode</label>
        <input class="form-control form-control-1-3" type="text" name="postcode" value=""><br><br>
        <label class="form-label" for="postcode">House name or number (optional)</label>
        <input class="form-control" type="text" name="postcode" value=""><br><br>
        <input type="submit" class="button" value="Find your address">
    </div>
<% end %>

## When to use this pattern

Use an address lookup when you’re asking users for a UK address. 
## When not to use this pattern

Address lookups generally only work for UK addresses. If you’re collecting only or mostly international addresses, you should use a manual option (either multiple fields or a free text box) instead.
How it works

An address lookup lets users specify a UK address by entering their postcode (and optionally their street name or number) and selecting their address from a list.

### When using an address lookup, you should:

- make it clear that it will only work for UK addresses
- provide a manual option for people with international addresses or addresses that are missing or not properly listed in the address lookup
- let people enter their postcodes in upper or lower case and with or without spaces

## Why this pattern is different from the GOV.UK pattern

This address lookup more closley matches the current back end database structure that HMRC have. Since introducing this pattern HMRC have been able to increase the quality of addresses captured.
