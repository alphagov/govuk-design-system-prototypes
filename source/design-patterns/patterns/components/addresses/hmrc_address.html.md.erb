## Before you start

The way you should ask for an address depends on what kind of address it is and what you need to do with it.

This guide describes 3 ways to ask for addresses and when to use them.


## Using a free text box

Use a free text box if you expect a broad range of address formats and you don’t need to use specific sub-parts of the address (for example, street or postcode).

Here’s an example:

### Advantages of a free text box

A free text box:

- can handle any possible address format
- allows users to copy and paste addresses from their clipboard
- means users don’t have to work out which part of the address goes in which field

### Disadvantages of a free text box

A free text box:

- makes it hard for you to separate an address into sub-parts, and impossible to do with 100% accuracy
- might not be compatible with legacy backend systems that use multi-field addresses
- can’t help users look up an address


## Using multiple fields

Only use multiple address fields when you know which regions the addresses will come from and can find a format that supports them all. This can be difficult to know if you’re asking for addresses outside the UK.


### Example of multiple fields

Here’s an example of a multiple address field pattern that works for simple UK addresses:

### Advantages of multiple fields

Multiple fields mean:

- you can easily extract and use specific parts of an address (for example, street names or postcodes)
- you can give help for individual fields
- you can validate each part of the address separately
- users can complete the form using their browser’s auto-complete function


### Disadvantages of multiple fields

Multiple fields have these disadvantages:

- it’s hard to find a single format that works for all addresses
- there’s no guarantee that users will use the fields the way you think they will
- users can’t easily paste addresses from their clipboard


### If you use multiple fields

When using multiple fields, you should:

- avoid making individual fields mandatory (but warn users if they don’t fill in any fields)
- make the fields the appropriate length for the content - it helps people understand the form (for example, make postcode fields shorter than street fields)
- not make fields case sensitive (let people use upper or lower case)
- write ‘postcode’ as one word
- let people enter postcodes with or without spaces

Royal Mail doesn’t need a county as long as the town and postcode are included, but you should include a county field so that people who don’t know their postcode can give a valid address.


## Using an address finder

An address finder (sometimes called a ‘postcode lookup’) lets users specify a UK address by entering their postcode (and optionally their street name or number) and selecting their address from a list.


#### Example of an address finder

Here’s how the Lasting Power of Attorney service used an address finder:

### Advantages of address finders

Using an address finder means that:

- people entering UK addresses don’t have to enter as much information manually
- there’s less chance of mis-typed UK addresses


### If you use an address finder

When using an address finder you should:

- make it clear that the address finder only works for UK addresses
- provide a manual option for people with international addresses or addresses that are missing or badly formed in the Royal Mail database
