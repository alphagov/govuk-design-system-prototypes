## Overview
This guide explains the 3 ways to ask users for an address and when to use them:

- [Address lookup](#using-an-address-lookup)
- [Multiple fields](#using-multiple-fields)
- [Free text box](#using-a-free-text-box)

**This is an [approved pattern](/design-patterns/patterns/overview/pattern_status/).
If it’s relevant to your service, you must use it as part of meeting the Digital
Service Standard.**

## Using an address lookup

Example

### When to use this pattern

Use an address lookup when you’re asking users for a UK address.

### When not to use this pattern

Address lookups generally only work for UK addresses. If you’re collecting only
or mostly international addresses, you should use a manual option (either
multiple fields or a free text box) instead.

### How it works

An address lookup lets users specify a UK address by entering their postcode
(and optionally their street name or number) and selecting their address from a
list.

When using an address lookup, you should:

- make it clear that it will only work for UK addresses
- provide a manual option for people with international addresses or addresses
  that are missing or not properly listed in the address lookup
- let people enter their postcodes in upper or lower case and with or without
  spaces

### Variations

## Using multiple fields
![Example using multiple fields](multiple-fields.png)

### When to use this pattern

Only use multiple address fields when you know which countries the addresses
will come from and can find a format that supports them all. This can be
difficult to know if you’re asking for addresses outside of the UK.

### How it works

Using multiple fields means:

- you can easily extract and use specific parts of an address
- you can give help for individual fields
- you can validate each part of the address separately
- users can complete the form using their browser’s auto-complete function

The disadvantages of multiple address fields are that:

- it’s hard to find a single format that works for all addresses
- there’s no guarantee that users will use the fields the way you think they
  will
- users can’t easily paste addresses from their clipboards

If you use multiple fields, you should:

- only make individual fields mandatory if you really need the information
- make the fields the appropriate length for the content - it helps people
  understand the form (for example, make postcode fields shorter than street
  fields
- let people enter their postcodes in upper or lower case and with or without
  spaces

Make sure there are enough fields to accommodate longer addresses if you know
your users will need them. For example, to allow them to include a company name
or flat number.

Royal mail doesn’t need a county as long as the town and postcode are included.
You should include an optional county field so that people who don’t know their
postcode can give a valid address.

## Using a free text box

Example:
![Example using a free text box](free-text-box.png)

### When to use this pattern

Use a free text box if you expect a broad range of address formats and you don’t
need to use specific sub-parts of the address (for example, street or postcode).

### When not to use this pattern

You shouldn’t use free text boxes if you:

- need to separate an address into accurate sub-parts (for example, street or
  postcode)
- are using a legacy backend system that can only use multiple field addresses
- need to help users look up an address

## How it works

Free text boxes let users enter any possible address format, meaning they don’t
need to work out which part of the address goes in which field.

Free text boxes make it easy for users to copy and paste addresses from their
clipboard.

## Research on this pattern

Read a blog post about testing and iterating the check before you start pattern.
