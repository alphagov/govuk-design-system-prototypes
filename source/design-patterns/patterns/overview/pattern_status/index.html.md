# Pattern statuses

## Approved

Approved patterns have been thoroughly tested and are ready to use in your
service.

To pass [point 13 (make the user experience consistent with GOV.UK
)][point-13] in your [service assessments][service-assessments], you must use
approved GOV.UK design patterns that are relevant to the service you’re building.

### Creating or changing patterns

If research shows that this pattern doesn’t meet your users’ needs, you can
adapt it or create a new one. If you do this, you must be able to provide
evidence of your user research in service assessments.

## Beta

Beta patterns have been tested in prototypes but need some further
research. They’re fairly stable, but are more likely to change than approved
patterns.

You can choose not to use a beta pattern and it won’t affect your service
assessment. If you do use one, you can share your feedback to help improve in
the Hackpad discussion for the pattern.

## Alpha

An alpha pattern is the first attempt at finding a solution to a recognised user
need. Limited testing has been carried out, and more research is needed to
answer important questions.

Alpha patterns are likely to change, and other solutions will usually be tried
out and tested before it moves into beta.

## Backlog

When a pattern is labelled ‘Backlog’, it means there’s an identified need to
start developing a solution to a common user need, but nothing has yet been
done.
