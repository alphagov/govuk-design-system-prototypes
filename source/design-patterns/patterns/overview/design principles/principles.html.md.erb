</hgroup>

<div class="outline">
<p>
Service design starts with identifying user needs. If you don’t
know what the user needs are, you won’t build the right thing. Do
research, analyse data, talk to users. Don’t make assumptions. Have
empathy for users, and remember that what they ask for isn’t
always what they need.

<h2 class="heading-large" id="second">Do less</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
Government should only do what only government can do. If we’ve
found a way of doing something that works, we should make it
reusable and shareable instead of reinventing the wheel every time.
This means building platforms and registers others can build upon,
providing resources (like APIs) that others can use, and linking to
the work of others. We should concentrate on the irreducible core.

<h2 class="heading-large" id="third">Design with data</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
In most cases, we can learn from real world behaviour by looking at
how existing services are used. Let data drive decision-making, not
hunches or guesswork. Keep doing that after taking your service
live, prototyping and testing with users then iterating in
response. Analytics should be built-in, always on and easy to read.
They’re an essential tool.

<h2 class="heading-large" id="fourth">Do the hard work to make it simple</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to
use is much harder — especially when the underlying systems are
complex — but that’s what we should be doing. Don’t take “It’s
always been that way” for an answer. It’s usually more and harder
work to make things simple, but it’s the right thing to do.

<h2 class="heading-large" id="fifth">Iterate. Then iterate again.</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
The best way to build good services is to start small and iterate
wildly. Release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum
Viable Products</a> early, test them with actual users, move from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha">Alpha</a>
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta">Beta</a>
to Live adding features, deleting things that don’t work and making
refinements based on feedback. Iteration reduces risk. It makes big
failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. If a
prototype isn’t working, don’t be afraid to scrap it and start
again.

<h2 class="heading-large" id="sixth">This is for everyone</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
Accessible design is good design. Everything we build should be as
inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to
sacrifice elegance — so be it. We’re building for needs, not
audiences. We’re designing for the whole country, not just the
ones who are used to using the web. The people who most need our
services are often the people who find them hardest to use. Let’s
think about those people from the start.

<h2 class="heading-large" id="seventh">Understand context</h2>
<div class="outline">
<p>
We’re not designing for a screen, we’re designing for people. We
need to think hard about the context in which they’re using our
services.  Are they in a library? Are they on a phone? Are they
only really familiar with Facebook? Have they never used the web
before?

<h2 class="heading-large" id="eighth">Build digital services, not websites</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job
is to uncover user needs, and build the service that meets those
needs. Of course much of that will be pages on the web, but we’re
not here to build websites. The digital world has to connect to the
real world, so we have to think about all aspects of a service, and
make sure they add up to something that meets user needs.

<article>

<h2 class="heading-large" id="ninth">Be consistent, not uniform</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
We should use the same language and the same design patterns
wherever possible. This helps people get familiar with our
services, but when this isn’t possible we should make sure our
approach is consistent.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t a straitjacket or a rule book. Every circumstance is
different. When we find patterns that work we should share them, and
talk about why we use them. But that shouldn’t stop us from
improving or changing them in the future when we find better ways of
doing things or the needs of users change.

<h2 class="heading-large" id="tenth">Make things open: it makes things better</h2>

<div class="outline">
<p>
We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. With
colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share
designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more
eyes there are on a service the better it gets — howlers are
spotted, better alternatives are pointed out, the bar is raised.
</p>
<p>
Much of what we’re doing is only possible because of open source
code and the generosity of the web design community. We should
pay that back.
