Use a task list page to show:

- the tasks involved in completing a transaction
- what order the tasks can be completed in
- which steps have already been completed

Read the guide on using, adapting and creating patterns before you start designing or building anything.

###Example of a task list page

##When to use this pattern
Only use this pattern for long transactions that users need multiple sessions to complete, or transactions that can be completed by multiple users.

Before you use a task list in your transaction you should first try to make it simple enough that your users don’t need one.

##Research on this pattern
[Read a blog post about testing and iterating this pattern.](#)
