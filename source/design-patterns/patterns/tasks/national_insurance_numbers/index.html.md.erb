This guide explains how to ask users to give you their National Insurance number.


### Use a single text field

Use a single text field labelled ‘National Insurance number’, like this:

![Example National Insurance number field](national-insurance-number-example_2x.png)

You should also:

- allow for 13 characters - National Insurance numbers are often spaced in pairs
- avoid using ‘NINO’ or ‘NI number’ as the label
- avoid using ‘AB 12 34 56 C’ as an example (it belongs to a real person) - use ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’ instead
