## Overview

Help users work out if they can or should use your service by asking them a
series of questions.

![Check before you start overview](check_before_you_start_1.png)

See a complete [example of ‘Check before you start’](https://check-before-you-start-pattern.cloudapps.digital/).

## When to use this pattern

You should help people find out whether your service is right for them as soon
as you can. Doing this means they won’t waste time trying to use it if they’re
not eligible or don’t need it.

Using ‘Check before you start’ can also lower your operating costs by reducing
the time and effort that support teams spend explaining your service.

For example, before deciding to use a service users often ask:

- am I eligible?
- how much will it cost to use?
- how much money will I get?
- how long will it take to get something?

Services also spend time and effort processing applications from users who don’t
need, aren’t eligible or aren’t ready to use a service.

## How it works

When using this pattern, you need to:

1. Ask a series of simple questions.
2. Automatically work out what a user needs to know.
3. Present the user with a ‘results’ page.

If there are general rules about whether a service can or can’t be used (for
example, an age limit or fixed deadline), include these on the start page.

### Ask simple questions

If you’re struggling to write simple questions because the policy is too
complicated, work with relevant teams in your organisation to make it simpler.

You’ll only be able to ask users clear questions when the process itself is
clear.

### Presenting results

Your results page could show the user:

- if they have to use your service
- if they’re eligible to use it
- how much it will cost them to use it
- how much money they’ll get from using it
- how long the whole process will take

If a user isn’t eligible to use your service, explain why.

Here’s an example of a results page:
